ISW believes that ground realities must drive the formulation of strategy and policy. In pursuit of this principle, ISW conducts detailed open-source intelligence analysis to provide timely and accurate information on current conflicts and security threats directly to policymakers and warfighters.

Interns at ISW have an unparalleled opportunity to analyze conflicts in ways that directly inform policy-makers on some of the most pressing issues facing American national security.

They receive classroom education, regular leadership engagement, and a chance to work with cutting-edge technologies employed in business and the intelligence community. Interns have the opportunity to stand at the front lines of military research and policy development, tackling the latest crises in the headlines.

The ISW Internship Program is one of three core education programs housed within The General David H.

Customer Engineer,PlanetScale,United States,On-site,2 weeks ago,Full-time · Entry level,"About the job
Why PlanetScale Customer Engineering?

Our Customer Engineering team provides upfront collaboration to a broad customer base. This creates an opportunity for continual learning. We have a tenacious customer focus with a high level of autonomy. If you see a problem and have the skills and motivation - fix it! You will be instrumental in getting the customer to a steady state, helping them grow, and observing their successes.

Job Summary

We build our platform on top of Vitess, built by our co-founders at YouTube and Google. We also provide enterprise support for customers running Vitess in their environment. To support both our cloud platform and enterprise customers, the Customer Engineering team leads the way. We are looking for a Customer Engineer to anchor our team.

What's the job to be done?

You will triage and prioritize customer issues, while collaborating with our Technical Account Management and Support teams.
You will work on finding the root cause for high priority customer issues, designing and implementing code fixes in our codebase, while collaborating as necessary with our core Engineering teams.

These attributes best describe you…

You have excellent debugging and troubleshooting skills; with a mix of enough experience and intuition to zero in on root-causes for bugs that can leave others stumped.
You are comfortable stepping outside your comfort zone. Be it delving into unfamiliar code in Vitess, one of its dependencies, or a random MySQL connector, written in a language you may not know (yet!). Working with code as your main source of documentation doesn't fluster you, and you are happy to help add/correct it as necessary where it may be inaccurate.
You can operate independently, but you know when you are in too deep and need to ask for help before going down a rabbit hole for days (or weeks!).
You know how to work under pressure in times of urgency. We and our customers both take issues with their data platform seriously.
You have good customer-facing skills. Even though your primary task isn't interacting directly with customers, we do believe in high-bandwidth engineer-to-engineer interaction with customers, where necessary, to troubleshoot issues.

What You Will Need

Experience deploying and running (or helping customers deploy and run) databases and applications, at scale
Experience with MySQL
Working knowledge of Kubernetes
Programming experience: Golang preferred; but deep experience in back-end server or systems programming at some point in your career, preferably on mission-critical, concurrent code.

What Else Will Help You Be Successful

Knowledge of common application deployment platforms and frameworks. Our customers use all kinds of languages and frameworks to speak to Vitess / PlanetScale. While no-one can possibly be fluent with all of them, knowledge of a few can be super-useful.
Experience working in a remote organization
Basic knowledge of open source development and communities

At PlanetScale we believe in supporting people to do their best work and thrive no matter the location. Our mission is to build a diverse, equitable, and inclusive company. We strive to build an inclusive environment where all people feel that they are equally respected and valued, whether they are a candidate or an employee. We welcome applicants of any educational background, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity, age, citizenship, socioeconomic status, disability, pregnancy status, and veteran status.

If you need any accommodations, please inform our Talent Acquisition team upon initial contact. We are happy to accommodate!

Total Compensation And Pay Transparency

An employee’s total compensation consists of base salary + variable comp where appropriate + benefits + equity. A member of our Talent Acquisition team will be happy to answer any further questions when we engage with you to begin the interview process.

Restaurant / Entertainment Supervisor #BowleroCorp,Bowlero Corporation,"Auburn, AL",On-site,1 week ago,Full-time · Entry level,"About the job
Overview

Imagine your ideal job. Now add bowling, arcade games, amazing parties, and the kind of food most people dream about at their desks. This isn’t any ordinary office; it’s the beginning of a bowled new career as a Supervisor with Bowlero Corp. Our Supervisors help oversee the in-center experience and bring it to life every day for their guests—maintaining a world-class standard and have a great time doing so.

The Supervisor role is one that’s always active. You’ll be on your feet, coordinating with team members, and assuming responsibility for all center operations in the absence of the General Manager, Assistant General Manager, or Manager at your center. Our Supervisors work diligently to ensure standards are high and are met with consistency. Make no mistake: this is definitely NOT your typical desk job (spoiler alert: it’s way better).

ESSENTIAL DUTIES: Get a glimpse of all you’ll experience as a Supervisor

KEEP STANDARDS HIGH
Work directly with your center’s associates to ensure our model of exemplary guest service is being followed 100% of the time. You’ll help set the standards (and enforce them)
MAKE GUESTS PRIORITY #1
Maintain a friendly and courteous disposition to all of our guests; walk the center routinely to observe associate/guest interactions and provide guidance as needed
HELP TRAIN A GREAT TEAM
Participate in recruiting, hiring, and training associates on an ongoing basis
BE AN ORGANIZATIONAL PRO
Maintain and analyze forms and report for center’s management team and assist in preparing financial records relating to the center’s daily operations
Help schedule center associates and maintain appropriate inventory levels
KNOW YOUR LANES
Assign open lanes and track their availability; prepare for our leagues and make sure they start on time
TAKE CARE WITH CASH
Follow cash control procedures (including prep and transport of daily deposits) as well as all opening/closing cash procedures (such as preparing reports for center management)
Who You Are

You’re a dedicated team player who’s looking for the opportunity to grow. You excel at developing talent and can partner with your center’s management team to deliver a world-class guest experience. Your communication skills are as strong as your commitment to exceptional service and your professional flexibility allows you to support the center through extended workdays, nights, weekends, and holidays. While entry-level, the Supervisor position may be seen as a gateway to more—a chance to learn the “ins & outs” of your center, develop as a leader, gain responsibility, and ultimately, move into a management role.

My Name is Carl Pratt, and you can reach me at 801.441.7990,
I am a Master Electrician and I have been an Electrician for over 47 years (since 1976). They say those that can.... do....
and those that can't.... Teach....

With a recent back surgery and a recent Total Knee Replacement, I am becoming a little slower physically, I will be 65 this year and with over 47 years of experience and a desire to be the best, I have acquired a lot of experience in a lot of areas over the last 47 years and the ability to help the best,,,, be the best.
From building a 25MVA with 12,500 Volts primary to 4160 Volts secondary Substation in the Coal Mines in Price in 1976, to roping houses in the Salt lake Valley and the entire Wasatch Front, in the early 1980's and now with doing nothing but Service, Troubleshooting and Repair since 1987,
I acquired my Journeyman Coal Mine papers by passing a Federal exam lasting 16 hours in 1977.
I acquired my Journeyman High Voltage Certificates in 1978 which allows me to work on 5000 Volts and higher
I acquired my Journeyman Electrician License in 1984
I acquired my Master Electrician License in 1996
I acquired my EPA license in 2006 allowing me to work with Freon and in the HVAC Industry

We formally worked as Cornerstones Electrical Services from 1999 to 2010, which I had closed down because of the Economy of 2008, Personal Injury and Health reasons,
Now at Lucent Pro Services, we would like to re-build a company with Career minded Employees and we are willing to take the time to Train and Research and Teach the ""Toughest of Questions"".

I have a desire to work with at least 100 Electricians before I Retire to become the best by building the Values and Knowledge that I have learned over the years and being proud of the fact that I have never failed an inspection from the City or County. (except maybe in the first 4 years as an Apprentice)

(This may be my way of... ""Be Fruitful and Multiply"").

Our Electricians are usually working in one of our Trucks and working alone unless they request help. therefore we are looking for 4th year Apprentices and Journeyman and Master Electricians to do Service from Salt Lake, Ogden, Payson, Park City and Tooele.
Our Electricians will be taking the Company Trucks home with them so that we can respond quickly to all of our Customers that need our help and at any hour of the day or night. (with on call schedules for nights and weekends).
All work performed on nights and weekends will be paid overtime rates even if they have not yet achieved the normal 40 hour workweek.
Our Electricians will be checking in with the office every morning between 7:30 and 8:00am. The office will send you on your first call of the day and give the Customer an ETA. then you will be on your way.
Our Electricians will be responsible to figure out what needs to be done and do all of the Pricing and Selling to the Customers (according to our ""Flat Rate"" price guide and with the guidance of me or the Office ), Chasing Material if you do not have it on your Van, Performing the Tasks, and finally collecting a payment from the Customer as you discussed with him / her in the Sales process. And of course all the paperwork associated as required by the Office.
Then you will call the Office and take your next Call.
Each of our Electricians will have something that they Excel in that others do not. we will try to make that expertise available to each of the other electricians to be able to reach out and learn from that Electrician. (Teamwork!!)
I have heard a lot of Electricians say ""I am an Electrician and not a Sales man"". What is Sales?. Sales is nothing more than developing the ability to convince a Customer of something that you firmly believe... if you believe something is fried and needs to be replaced, all you need to do is convince the Customer that this is what you firmly believe.
I tell each Electrician that if they can spend 80% of their focus on their ability to convince the customer what they firmly believe, everything else comes natural and at some point so will Selling.

I will never require an Electrician to do something that I would not be willing to do myself. and I will never try to sell a Customer something that he/she does not need, unless there is a benefit such as Whole House Surge Suppressors, Smoke Alarms, CO Detectors, GFCI's etc....



Qualifications
There is a big difference between an Electrician looking for a Job, and an Electrician looking for a Career.

Job:
This Electrician wants to work 8 hours a day and then wants to go home and ""Unplug"".
This Electrician counts on the Company to Provide all Tools, Training and Motivation.
This Electrician can be compared to as an assembly plant worker, They assemble Houses and Buildings, and they become very fast and efficient at doing it, ( you may have 1 person running pipe, 2 people pulling wire, 1 or 2 people doing the Service and Switch Gear etc..) and they become very good and fast at it, (I probably could not compete with this skill ) however if something shorts out.... or a GFCI or an AFCI keeps tripping, they may need their Supervisor to help them troubleshoot it.

Career:
This Electrician is usually motivated by ""Helping people in need"" and not so much in building infrastructure.
This Electrician is almost always trying to learn how and why things work and why are they Required by the NEC.
This Electrician is fascinated by Technology and the ""Latest and Greatest"" in tools to help him troubleshoot better or make repairs faster.
This Electrician will have a very impressive set of ""tools of the trade"" and take a lot of pride in what he / she can accomplish with them (and usually are not willing to share them with Teammates).
This Electrician is not afraid to use their after hours time to browse YouTube videos or attend Seminars and Classes to learn everything from how to fix common problems and how does this actually work, to... how do I learn to sell and deal with a tough Customer.
This Electrician takes a lot of pride in how a job looks to the Customer, and how ""Future Proofed"" and ""Reliable"" it is and that everything this Electrician does will pass all Local, Utility and National Electric Codes.

If you buy a brand new Car, 6 months later it develops a knock in the Engine, are you going to take that Car to an assembly plant worker to tell you what is wrong with it?

People have often pointed out how difficult and expensive it is to Train Employees, and usually after they learn, they want to leave and Start their own or share their talents with other companies.
But.... What happens if you don't Train them and they Stay....

I have always prided myself in building a good reputation with our Customers and the Inspectors, I know a lot of Inspectors and Trainers that I consider to be good friends, all of which will be more that willing to help me learn anything that comes to me that I cannot answer. I do not have a problem with competing with Companies that know what they are doing and take pride in what they do, (I still stay in contact with many of my old Employees from 20 years ago, and they still call me to help them figure something out.). it is the ones that do not know what they are doing and simply do not care that makes it tough. Too many of these Companies are more interested in the Dollar and not the Quality or the Pride that comes with the type of Work performed.

After all, How can you Soar with the Eagles when you work with Turkeys."

The organization serves the Church worldwide to promote the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.

Samaritan's Purse Statement Of Faith

We believe the Bible to be the inspired, the only infallible, authoritative Word of God. (1 Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Timothy 3:15-17)
We believe that there is one God, eternally existent in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. (Matthew 28:19; John 10:30; Ephesians 4:4-6)
We believe in the deity of the Lord Jesus Christ, in His virgin birth, in His sinless life, in His miracles, in His vicarious and atoning death through His shed blood on the cross, in His bodily resurrection, in His ascension to the right hand of the Father, and in His personal return in power and glory. (Matthew 1:23; John 1:1-4 and 1:29; Acts 1:11 and 2:22-24; Romans 8:34; 1 Corinthians 15:3-4; 2 Corinthians 5:21; Philippians 2:5-11; Hebrews 1:1-4 and 4:15)
We believe that all men everywhere are lost and face the judgment of God, that Jesus Christ is the only way of salvation, and that for the salvation of lost and sinful man, repentance of sin and faith in Jesus Christ results in regeneration by the Holy Spirit. (Luke 24:46-47; John 14:6; Acts 4:12; Romans 3:23; 2 Corinthians 5:10-11; Ephesians 1:7 and 2:8-9; Titus 3:4-7)
We believe in the present ministry of the Holy Spirit, whose indwelling enables the Christian to live a godly life. (John 3:5-8; Acts 1:8 and 4:31; Romans 8:9; 1 Corinthians 2:14; Galatians 5:16-18; Ephesians 6:12; Colossians 2:6-10)
We believe in the resurrection of both the saved and the lost; the saved unto the resurrection of eternal life and the lost unto the resurrection of damnation and eternal punishment. (1 Corinthians 15:51-57; Revelation 20:11-15)
We believe in the spiritual unity of believers in the Lord Jesus Christ and that all true believers are members of His body, the church. (1 Corinthians 12:12, 27; Ephesians 1:22-23)
We believe that the ministry of evangelism and discipleship is a responsibility of all followers of Jesus Christ. (Matthew 28:18-20; Acts 1:8; Romans 10:9-15; 1 Peter 3:15)
We believe God’s plan for human sexuality is to be expressed only within the context of marriage, that God created man and woman as unique biological persons made to complete each other. God instituted monogamous marriage between male and female as the foundation of the family and the basic structure of human society. For this reason, we believe that marriage is exclusively the union of one genetic male and one genetic female. (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:5-6; Mark 10:6-9; Romans 1:26-27; 1 Corinthians 6:9)
We believe that we must dedicate ourselves to prayer, to the service of our Lord, to His authority over our lives, and to the ministry of evangelism. (Matthew 9:35-38; 22:37-39, and 28:18-20; Acts 1:8; Romans 10:9-15 and 12:20-21; Galatians 6:10; Colossians 2:6-10; 1 Peter 3:15)
We believe that human life is sacred from conception to its natural end; and that we must have concern for the physical and spiritual needs of our fellowmen. (Psalm 139:13; Isaiah 49:1; Jeremiah 1:5; Matthew 22:37-39; Romans 12:20-21; Galatians 6:10)"

Samaritan's Purse Mission Statement

Samaritan's Purse is a nondenominational evangelical Christian organization providing spiritual and physical aid to hurting people around the world. Since 1970, Samaritan's Purse has helped meet the needs of people who are victims of war, poverty, natural disasters, disease, and famine with the purpose of sharing God's love through His Son, Jesus Christ. The organization serves the Church worldwide to promote the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.

Samaritan's Purse Statement Of Faith

We believe the Bible to be the inspired, the only infallible, authoritative Word of God. (1 Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Timothy 3:15-17)
We believe that there is one God, eternally existent in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. (Matthew 28:19; John 10:30; Ephesians 4:4-6)
We believe in the deity of the Lord Jesus Christ, in His virgin birth, in His sinless life, in His miracles, in His vicarious and atoning death through His shed blood on the cross, in His bodily resurrection, in His ascension to the right hand of the Father, and in His personal return in power and glory. (Matthew 1:23; John 1:1-4 and 1:29; Acts 1:11 and 2:22-24; Romans 8:34; 1 Corinthians 15:3-4; 2 Corinthians 5:21; Philippians 2:5-11; Hebrews 1:1-4 and 4:15)
We believe that all men everywhere are lost and face the judgment of God, that Jesus Christ is the only way of salvation, and that for the salvation of lost and sinful man, repentance of sin and faith in Jesus Christ results in regeneration by the Holy Spirit. (Luke 24:46-47; John 14:6; Acts 4:12; Romans 3:23; 2 Corinthians 5:10-11; Ephesians 1:7 and 2:8-9; Titus 3:4-7)
We believe in the present ministry of the Holy Spirit, whose indwelling enables the Christian to live a godly life. (John 3:5-8; Acts 1:8 and 4:31; Romans 8:9; 1 Corinthians 2:14; Galatians 5:16-18; Ephesians 6:12; Colossians 2:6-10)
We believe in the resurrection of both the saved and the lost; the saved unto the resurrection of eternal life and the lost unto the resurrection of damnation and eternal punishment. (1 Corinthians 15:51-57; Revelation 20:11-15)
We believe in the spiritual unity of believers in the Lord Jesus Christ and that all true believers are members of His body, the church. (1 Corinthians 12:12, 27; Ephesians 1:22-23)
We believe that the ministry of evangelism and discipleship is the responsibility of all followers of Jesus Christ. (Matthew 28:18-20; Acts 1:8; Romans 10:9-15; 1 Peter 3:15)
We believe God’s plan for human sexuality is to be expressed only within the context of marriage, that God created man and woman as unique biological persons made to complete each other. God instituted monogamous marriage between male and female as the foundation of the family and the basic structure of human society. For this reason, we believe that marriage is exclusively the union of one genetic male and one genetic female. (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:5-6; Mark 10:6-9; Romans 1:26-27; 1 Corinthians 6:9)
We believe that we must dedicate ourselves to prayer, to the service of our Lord, to His authority over our lives, and to the ministry of evangelism. (Matthew 9:35-38; 22:37-39, and 28:18-20; Acts 1:8; Romans 10:9-15 and 12:20-21; Galatians 6:10; Colossians 2:6-10; 1 Peter 3:15)
We believe that human life is sacred from conception to its natural end; and that we must have concern for the physical and spiritual needs of our fellowmen. (Psalm 139:13; Isaiah 49:1; Jeremiah 1:5; Matthew 22:37-39; Romans 12:20-21; Galatians 6:10)"

This isn’t any ordinary office; it’s the beginning of a bowled new career as a Supervisor with Bowlero Corp. Our Supervisors help oversee the in-center experience and bring it to life every day for their guests—maintaining a world-class standard and have a great time doing so.

The Supervisor role is one that’s always active. You’ll be on your feet, coordinating with team members, and assuming responsibility for all center operations in the absence of the General Manager, Assistant General Manager, or Manager at your center.

You’re a dedicated team player who’s looking for the opportunity to grow. You excel at developing talent and can partner with your center’s management team to deliver a world-class guest experience. Your communication skills are as strong as your commitment to exceptional service and your professional flexibility allows you to support the center through extended workdays, nights, weekends, and holidays. While entry-level, the Supervisor position may be seen as a gateway to more—a chance to learn the “ins & outs” of your center, develop as a leader, gain responsibility, and ultimately, move into a management role.

The organization serves the Church worldwide to promote the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.

Samaritan's Purse Statement Of Faith

We believe the Bible to be the inspired, the only infallible, authoritative Word of God. (1 Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Timothy 3:15-17)
We believe that there is one God, eternally existent in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. (Matthew 28:19; John 10:30; Ephesians 4:4-6)
We believe in the deity of the Lord Jesus Christ, in His virgin birth, in His sinless life, in His miracles, in His vicarious and atoning death through His shed blood on the cross, in His bodily resurrection, in His ascension to the right hand of the Father, and in His personal return in power and glory. (Matthew 1:23; John 1:1-4 and 1:29; Acts 1:11 and 2:22-24; Romans 8:34; 1 Corinthians 15:3-4; 2 Corinthians 5:21; Philippians 2:5-11; Hebrews 1:1-4 and 4:15)
We believe that all men everywhere are lost and face the judgment of God, that Jesus Christ is the only way of salvation, and that for the salvation of lost and sinful man, repentance of sin and faith in Jesus Christ results in regeneration by the Holy Spirit. (Luke 24:46-47; John 14:6; Acts 4:12; Romans 3:23; 2 Corinthians 5:10-11; Ephesians 1:7 and 2:8-9; Titus 3:4-7)
We believe in the present ministry of the Holy Spirit, whose indwelling enables the Christian to live a godly life. (John 3:5-8; Acts 1:8 and 4:31; Romans 8:9; 1 Corinthians 2:14; Galatians 5:16-18; Ephesians 6:12; Colossians 2:6-10)
We believe in the resurrection of both the saved and the lost; the saved unto the resurrection of eternal life and the lost unto the resurrection of damnation and eternal punishment. (1 Corinthians 15:51-57; Revelation 20:11-15)
We believe in the spiritual unity of believers in the Lord Jesus Christ and that all true believers are members of His body, the church. (1 Corinthians 12:12, 27; Ephesians 1:22-23)
We believe that the ministry of evangelism and discipleship is a responsibility of all followers of Jesus Christ. (Matthew 28:18-20; Acts 1:8; Romans 10:9-15; 1 Peter 3:15)
We believe God’s plan for human sexuality is to be expressed only within the context of marriage, that God created man and woman as unique biological persons made to complete each other. God instituted monogamous marriage between male and female as the foundation of the family and the basic structure of human society. For this reason, we believe that marriage is exclusively the union of one genetic male and one genetic female. (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:5-6; Mark 10:6-9; Romans 1:26-27; 1 Corinthians 6:9)
We believe that we must dedicate ourselves to prayer, to the service of our Lord, to His authority over our lives, and to the ministry of evangelism. (Matthew 9:35-38; 22:37-39, and 28:18-20; Acts 1:8; Romans 10:9-15 and 12:20-21; Galatians 6:10; Colossians 2:6-10; 1 Peter 3:15)
We believe that human life is sacred from conception to its natural end; and that we must have concern for the physical and spiritual needs of our fellowmen. (Psalm 139:13; Isaiah 49:1; Jeremiah 1:5; Matthew 22:37-39; Romans 12:20-21; Galatians 6:10)"

Samaritan's Purse Mission Statement

Samaritan's Purse is a nondenominational evangelical Christian organization providing spiritual and physical aid to hurting people around the world. Since 1970, Samaritan's Purse has helped meet needs of people who are victims of war, poverty, natural disasters, disease, and famine with the purpose of sharing God's love through His Son, Jesus Christ. The organization serves the Church worldwide to promote the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.

Samaritan's Purse Statement Of Faith

We believe the Bible to be the inspired, the only infallible, authoritative Word of God. (1 Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Timothy 3:15-17)
We believe that there is one God, eternally existent in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. (Matthew 28:19; John 10:30; Ephesians 4:4-6)
We believe in the deity of the Lord Jesus Christ, in His virgin birth, in His sinless life, in His miracles, in His vicarious and atoning death through His shed blood on the cross, in His bodily resurrection, in His ascension to the right hand of the Father, and in His personal return in power and glory. (Matthew 1:23; John 1:1-4 and 1:29; Acts 1:11 and 2:22-24; Romans 8:34; 1 Corinthians 15:3-4; 2 Corinthians 5:21; Philippians 2:5-11; Hebrews 1:1-4 and 4:15)
We believe that all men everywhere are lost and face the judgment of God, that Jesus Christ is the only way of salvation, and that for the salvation of lost and sinful man, repentance of sin and faith in Jesus Christ results in regeneration by the Holy Spirit. (Luke 24:46-47; John 14:6; Acts 4:12; Romans 3:23; 2 Corinthians 5:10-11; Ephesians 1:7 and 2:8-9; Titus 3:4-7)
We believe in the present ministry of the Holy Spirit, whose indwelling enables the Christian to live a godly life. (John 3:5-8; Acts 1:8 and 4:31; Romans 8:9; 1 Corinthians 2:14; Galatians 5:16-18; Ephesians 6:12; Colossians 2:6-10)
We believe in the resurrection of both the saved and the lost; the saved unto the resurrection of eternal life and the lost unto the resurrection of damnation and eternal punishment. (1 Corinthians 15:51-57; Revelation 20:11-15)
We believe in the spiritual unity of believers in the Lord Jesus Christ and that all true believers are members of His body, the church. (1 Corinthians 12:12, 27; Ephesians 1:22-23)
We believe that the ministry of evangelism and discipleship is a responsibility of all followers of Jesus Christ. (Matthew 28:18-20; Acts 1:8; Romans 10:9-15; 1 Peter 3:15)
We believe God’s plan for human sexuality is to be expressed only within the context of marriage, that God created man and woman as unique biological persons made to complete each other. God instituted monogamous marriage between male and female as the foundation of the family and the basic structure of human society. For this reason, we believe that marriage is exclusively the union of one genetic male and one genetic female. (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:5-6; Mark 10:6-9; Romans 1:26-27; 1 Corinthians 6:9)
We believe that we must dedicate ourselves to prayer, to the service of our Lord, to His authority over our lives, and to the ministry of evangelism. (Matthew 9:35-38; 22:37-39, and 28:18-20; Acts 1:8; Romans 10:9-15 and 12:20-21; Galatians 6:10; Colossians 2:6-10; 1 Peter 3:15)
We believe that human life is sacred from conception to its natural end; and that we must have concern for the physical and spiritual needs of our fellowmen. (Psalm 139:13; Isaiah 49:1; Jeremiah 1:5; Matthew 22:37-39; Romans 12:20-21; Galatians 6:10)"

About Mynela Staffing

At Mynela Staffing, we do things differently.

How?

Most agencies create their pay packages by factoring in the “benefits” they give to you. Meaning, every perk or reimbursement given to you actually comes out of your package. At Mynela, we give you Bottom Line Pay Packages---- instead of taking huge margins and breaking down your pay into many various things such as reimbursements, relocation, bonuses (which gets heavily taxed) we throw it all back into YOUR weekly gross! With Mynela, you're in control of your money!

Our main focus is understanding your interests and goals, so we can match you with the best paying travel contracts with leading hospitals across the US.

Why us?
